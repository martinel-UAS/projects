    "go to https://github.com/miaow1988/SqueezeNet_v1.2 and download the 'symbol.json' and '.params' files (there is not a 'synset.txt' file! so don't use these lines, Hint: just comment these lines).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Install MXNet v1.5 (hint: create a new conda environmet with python 3, pip install mxnet==1.5.1) and follow the same steps of the lecture (part: *Using pre-trained models as feature extractors*). Find the flatten output layer and create a feature extractor (hint: It should be a numpy array of 1000 elements).\n",
    "* Download the dogs versus cats *training folder* from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data (Remember the number of images is 12500 for each class).\n",
    "* Extract the array of features for different number of images (N: 10, 100, 500, 1000, also 5000 and 12500) and for each value train your favorite binary classifier (only one!!!) using GridSearch to optimize some hyperparameters. Consider to use https://notebooks.csc.fi if you have computational limitations. \n",
