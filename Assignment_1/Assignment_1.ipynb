    "Database contains records for 1885 respondents. For each respondent 12 attributes are known: Personality measurements which include NEO-FFI-R (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness), BIS-11 (impulsivity), and ImpSS (sensation seeking), level of education, age, gender, country of residence and ethnicity. All input attributes are originally categorical and are quantified. After quantification values of all input features can be considered as real-valued. In addition, participants were questioned concerning their use of 18 legal and illegal drugs (alcohol, amphetamines, amyl nitrite, benzodiazepine, cannabis, chocolate, cocaine, caffeine, crack, ecstasy, heroin, ketamine, legal highs, LSD, methadone, mushrooms, nicotine and volatile substance abuse and one fictitious drug (Semeron) which was introduced to identify over-claimers. For each drug they have to select one of the answers: never used the drug, used it over a decade ago, or in the last decade, year, month, week, or day.\n",

    "Database contains 18 classification problems. Each of independent label variables contains seven classes: \"Never Used\", \"Used over a Decade Ago\", \"Used in Last Decade\", \"Used in Last Year\", \"Used in Last Month\", \"Used in Last Week\", and \"Used in Last Day\".\n",

    "* Fit one multiclass classification model for all the rest 16 features. Comment on the accuracy of predicting each feature, for all the seven classes. \n",
    "* Run one binary classification model for 3 features out of 18. Test the performance of the model by choosing as:\n",
